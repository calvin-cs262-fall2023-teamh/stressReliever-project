# Fidget Czar

Our application, Figet Czar, is a stress relief app designed to be a tranquil haven in the midst of life's daily chaos. Our overarching design objective for Figet Czar is to create a user-friendly platform that seamlessly integrates mindfulness, creativity, and decision-making features, providing a multifaceted approach to stress relief and mental well-being.

While the market offers various stress relief applications, Figet Czar distinguishes itself through its comprehensive approach to relaxation. Going beyond conventional meditation apps, our platform integrates dynamic elements like fidgeting and drawing functions, furnishing users with a versatile toolkit for stress management. Additionally, the inclusion of user profiles with activity logs provides tailored insights, fostering a deeper connection to one's own journey toward well-being.

Key Features:

1. Fidget Component: Incorporates a range of interactive activities (like a fidget spinner, color-changing button, etc.) designed to divert restless energy, promoting relaxation and focus.

2. Drawing Functionality: Provides a creative outlet for expression and relaxation, enabling users to engage with soothing visual activities. There will also be a feature where you can keep track of previous drawings to revisit or edit them later.

3. User Profile with Activity Log: Allows users to track their engagement and progress within the app, providing a tangible record of their stress relief journey.

4. Share: Allows the user to share previous drawings or activities with others.
