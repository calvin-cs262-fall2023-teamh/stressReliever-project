# MindfulKnights

In an era where the demands of school life continue to escalate, students find themselves amidst an ever-mounting pressure cooker. The constant rise in academic stress has created an urgent need for tools that aid in navigating this overwhelming landscape. It's in response to this escalating pressure that MindfulKnights was conceived.
